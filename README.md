# Hey there — I'm **Suraj Bansal** 👋🏽

I'm a Health Sciences freshman at [McMaster University](https://bhsc.mcmaster.ca/) and student researcher at [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.jdstemcellresearch.ca/). As an aspiring clinican-scientist, my current research interrogates a combination of single-cell omic, pharmacogenomic, and bioinformatic approaches to understand how cancer proliferates and becomes resistant to chemotherapy. This summer, I'm supported by the [T-CAIREM studentship](https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/summer-research-studentships) in developing a cloud-based bioinformatics pipeline for transcriptomic meta-analysis in blood development and leukaemia.
