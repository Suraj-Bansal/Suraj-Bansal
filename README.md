# Hey there — I'm **Suraj Bansal** 👋🏽

I'm a second-year Health Sciences at [McMaster University](https://bhsc.mcmaster.ca/) and student researcher at [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.jdstemcellresearch.ca/). As an aspiring clinican-scientist, my current research explores a combination of single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning approaches to investigate stemness and disease heterogeneity in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. This summer, I'm supported by the [T-CAIREM studentship](https://tcairem.utoronto.ca/summer-research-studentships) in developing a cloud-based bioinformatics pipeline for transcriptomic meta-analysis in blood development and leukaemia. I'm also Managing Editor of [The Meducator](https://issuu.com/themeducator) where I oversee the publication process of McMaster's open-access, peer-reviewed Undergraduate Health Sciences Journal.
