# Hey there — I'm **Suraj Bansal** 👋🏽

I'm a second-year MD Student at [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/) and research student at [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.jdstemcellresearch.ca/). As an aspiring clinician-scientist, I am interested in applying single-cell multi-omic, machine learning, and experimental approaches to investigate disease heterogeneity and advance precision medicine in acute leukemias. To decompress you'll usually find me exploring local coffeeshops, playing squash or tumbling down ski slopes. If you're interested in learning about my projects and endeavours, reachout at sbans087@uottawa.ca or follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/surajbansal2003) to chat!
